# Fake-News-Detection

Fake news, defined by the New York Times as “a made-up story with an intention to deceive” the readers. We decide whether a news article is fake or not by looking into what different news organizations say about the topic. If most of the news organizations agree with the topic, then the news is most likely to be correct. So, in this project,given a News Article, we classify whether it is fake or not by deciding whether the News Article Body Agrees/Disagrees/Discusses/Unrelated to the headline.
